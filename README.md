# ToDo-JavaScript A Basic To Do List

### A Basic To-Do List built with JavaScript, Node, MongoDB, and it is deployed to Heroku as a live app with a MongoDB.

I used this project to learn more about JavaScript, Node, MongoDB and deploying to Heroku.
You can view the live app at. I have replaced the remote MongoDB connection with a localhost in this repo. The hosted application is connected to a remote Atlas MongoDB Instance.
